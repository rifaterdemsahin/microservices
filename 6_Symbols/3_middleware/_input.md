Here's a breakdown of the commands with comments and rationale:

```bash
# 1. Maven command to clean the project and build the package
# This removes previous build artifacts and creates a new artifact (e.g., JAR, WAR file).
mvn clean package

# 2. Gradle command to build the application as an executable jar
# This command builds the Spring Boot application into an executable JAR file.
./gradlew bootJar

# 3. Docker build command to create an image for the backend service
# This command builds a Docker image named 'ntier-backend' using the Dockerfile in the current directory.
docker build -t ntier-backend .

# 4. Docker run command to start the backend service in a container, exposing port 8080
# This runs the 'ntier-backend' image in a container and maps port 8080 on the host to port 8080 in the container.
docker run -p 8080:8080 ntier-backend

# 5. Docker Compose command to build and start services defined in the docker-compose.yml
# This builds images and starts all services (backend, database, etc.) defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
docker-compose up --build
```

### Rationale:
1. **Maven/Gradle Build**: These steps ensure the application is compiled and packaged into a distributable artifact. Maven (`mvn clean package`) and Gradle (`./gradlew bootJar`) serve similar purposes, with the choice between the two depending on the build tool in use for the project.
2. **Docker Build and Run**: After the app is built, Docker is used to containerize it. The `docker build` command creates an image, and `docker run` runs that image in a container, exposing the necessary ports.
3. **Docker Compose**: This is typically used when there are multiple services (e.g., a database alongside the backend). `docker-compose up --build` ensures all necessary services are built and started together.
