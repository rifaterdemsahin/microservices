Based on your setup, here are the commands you'll want to run to rebuild your application with the fixed configuration:

1. First, navigate to the root of your project (where the docker-compose.yml file is located):
```bash
cd /workspaces/microservices/6_Symbols
```

2. Stop any running containers from your previous build (if any):
```bash
docker-compose down
```

3. Rebuild the application container with the updated configuration:
```bash
docker-compose build app
```

4. Start all the services defined in your docker-compose.yml:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To verify everything is working correctly:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

This should show all three services (middleware_app, backend_db, and web_server) running.

If you want to check the logs of your middleware application to ensure it started properly:

```bash
docker-compose logs app
```

If you made changes to the Dockerfile or need a clean build, you can use:

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache app
docker-compose up -d
```

These commands will ensure your application is rebuilt with the corrected file mappings and configurations.
