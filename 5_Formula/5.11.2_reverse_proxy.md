Let me explain in detail how this solution solves the communication problem between your frontend and backend:

## The Problem of Cross-Origin Requests

When your frontend runs in a browser, it's subject to something called the Same-Origin Policy. This security measure prevents a web page from making requests to a different domain/port than the one it was loaded from. In your case:

1. Your frontend is served at: `http://localhost:80`
2. Your API is running at: `http://localhost:8080`

Even though these are both on localhost, the different ports make them different origins, so direct requests are blocked by default.

## How the Nginx Reverse Proxy Solves This

A reverse proxy acts as an intermediary between clients (browsers) and your backend servers. Here's the magic it performs:

1. **Unified Origin**: Nginx serves everything from the same origin (`http://localhost:80`). This means:
   - Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are served directly from Nginx (`location / {...}`)
   - API requests are proxied transparently to your Spring Boot app (`location /api/ {...}`)

2. **Request Forwarding**: When a user's browser makes a request to `/api/data`, Nginx receives it and forwards it to `http://app:8080/api/data` internally. This happens server-side, where the Same-Origin Policy doesn't apply.

3. **Response Delivery**: Nginx then takes the Spring Boot response and passes it back to the browser. From the browser's perspective, both the HTML page and the API response came from the same server (`http://localhost:80`).

## Why Docker Service Names Work

Inside your Docker network:
- Services can communicate using their service names as hostnames (e.g., `http://app:8080`)
- This works because Docker sets up internal DNS resolution within the `app-network` you defined

However, your browser doesn't know about these Docker service names. That's why:
- In your frontend code, you use `/api/data` (a relative path)
- Nginx handles the translation between what the browser sees and what your Docker services need

## The Complete Request Flow

1. User clicks "Fetch Data" in the browser
2. Browser makes request to `http://localhost:80/api/data`
3. Nginx receives this request
4. Nginx's config matches the `/api/` location block
5. Nginx forwards the request to `http://app:8080/api/data`
6. Spring Boot processes the request and returns JSON data
7. Nginx receives the response from Spring Boot
8. Nginx sends this response back to the browser
9. Your JavaScript code displays the data on the page

This approach effectively bypasses CORS issues while maintaining a clean separation between your services. It's a standard pattern in web architecture that allows multi-tier applications to appear seamless to the end user.
