You don’t need Gradle (`gradlew`) if you’ve already built the JAR using Maven. Maven and Gradle are both build automation tools, but they are different in how they manage dependencies, build configurations, and automation tasks.

### Key Differences Between Maven and Gradle:
1. **Build System:**
   - **Maven**: Uses XML-based `pom.xml` for configuration.
   - **Gradle**: Uses Groovy/Kotlin-based `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`.

2. **Performance:**
   - **Maven**: Slower due to sequential build execution.
   - **Gradle**: Faster due to incremental builds and caching.

3. **Flexibility:**
   - **Maven**: More convention-driven and structured.
   - **Gradle**: More flexible, allowing custom build logic.

4. **Usage in Your Case:**
   - Since you already built the JAR with Maven (`mvn package` or `mvn install`), you **do not need Gradle** unless your project specifically requires it for another reason.

#### What to Do?
- If your project uses Maven, you should run:  
  ```
  mvn package
  ```
  This will generate the JAR in the `target/` directory.
  
- If your project is configured for Gradle but you used Maven, make sure there are no conflicts. Otherwise, just stick with Maven.
