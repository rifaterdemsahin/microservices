Here's a `Dockerfile` for your **N-Tier Java application** with a Spring Boot backend and React frontend, designed to run in **GitHub Codespaces**. I'll also include a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage the multi-container setup.

I've created the Dockerfile for the **Spring Boot backend**. Next, do you want me to add a `docker-compose.yml` file to handle the PostgreSQL database and React frontend as well? ðŸš€

```
# Backend - Spring Boot Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the backend application JAR
COPY target/NtierApplication.jar app.jar

# Expose backend port
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the Spring Boot application
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```
