Whitelabel Error Page
This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.

There was an unexpected error (type=Not Found, status=404).

why and how to fix it ?

The 404 error you're seeing typically occurs when a URL is not properly mapped to a controller in your Spring Boot application. The specific issue may arise from a few possible causes:

1. **Context Path Issue:**
   Sometimes, when deploying to GitHub Codespaces or any remote server, the application might have a context path prefix that is not included in your URL. For instance, your `/api/data` endpoint might actually be available at something like `/app/api/data`.

   **Solution**: Check if there is a base context path (e.g., `/app`) that needs to be included in the URL. You can do this by verifying your applicationâ€™s `application.properties` or `application.yml` file for any `server.servlet.context-path` setting.

2. **Missing `@RequestMapping` or Incorrect Path:**
   Ensure that your controller mapping and method mapping are correct and that the path is available. Double-check if the `@RequestMapping("/api")` and `@GetMapping("/data")` are functioning correctly.

   **Solution**: The code you posted seems fine, so ensure that the application context is correctly configured and that there are no issues with how it's running or being accessed.

3. **Spring Boot Startup Issue:**
   The application might not have started up properly, and the endpoint might not be registered in the server.

   **Solution**: Verify that the application started without any issues and that the `DataController` is registered. You can do this by checking the logs for any startup errors.

4. **Cross-Origin Issues (CORS):**
   Although you have configured `@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")`, sometimes the client and server being on different origins (e.g., GitHub Codespaces) can cause problems due to CORS misconfiguration or issues with how the frontend accesses the backend.

   **Solution**: Try checking your frontend application to make sure it's sending requests to the correct backend URL, and ensure there are no CORS-related issues blocking the request.

5. **Incorrect URL or Port Issue:**
   It seems you're accessing the endpoint via `https://supreme-system-vwrx9j7ppq2vj6-8080.app.github.dev/api/data`. Double-check the URL, ensuring the port `8080` is accessible and matches what the Spring Boot application is using. GitHub Codespaces might use a different port or protocol for the backend.

   **Solution**: Confirm that the Spring Boot app is running on port 8080 or any other port as configured in your `application.properties` file. If it's running on a different port, update the URL accordingly.

6. **GitHub Codespaces Configuration:**
   Since you mentioned using GitHub Codespaces, sometimes the environment setup might require specific configuration to allow external access to the application.

   **Solution**: Check the GitHub Codespaces documentation for any special setup instructions related to exposing Spring Boot applications via a public URL, as GitHub Codespaces may require adjustments in how the application is exposed.

If none of these fixes resolve the issue, try running the application locally or in a different environment to ensure the code is correct, and confirm if the problem lies with GitHub Codespaces or the application itself.

To help clarify where to place the configuration, I'll break it down based on the areas that could be affecting your Spring Boot application:

### 1. **Server Port Configuration:**
   You should place this in the `application.properties` file if you want to explicitly set the port:
   ```properties
   server.port=8080
   ```

   If you don't have `application.properties`, you can create one under `src/main/resources/`.

### 2. **Context Path Configuration:**
   If you suspect the issue is related to the context path, you can add this setting in `application.properties` to set or adjust the context path (if necessary):
   ```properties
   server.servlet.context-path=/app
   ```

   This will cause all URLs in your application to be prefixed with `/app`. For example, your endpoint would be `http://localhost:8080/app/api/data` when accessed locally, or `https://supreme-system-vwrx9j7ppq2vj6-8080.app.github.dev/app/api/data` when accessed in GitHub Codespaces.

### 3. **CORS Configuration:**
   You've already configured `@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")`, which is correct for allowing cross-origin requests. This should remain in your controller above the `@RequestMapping`:
   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api")
   @CrossOrigin(origins = "*")  // This allows all origins
   public class DataController {
   ```

### 4. **Spring Boot Controller**:
   Your controller code looks good, and it should be located in a package that's correctly scanned by Spring Boot (usually under `src/main/java/com/example/controller`). Your `DataController` looks like this:
   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/api")
   @CrossOrigin(origins = "*")  // This allows all origins
   public class DataController {

       @GetMapping("/data")
       public Map<String, Object> getData() {
           Map<String, Object> data = new HashMap<>();
           data.put("message", "Hello from Spring Boot backend!");
           data.put("status", "success");
           data.put("timestamp", System.currentTimeMillis());
           return data;
       }
   }
   ```

### 5. **Check GitHub Codespaces Port Exposure:**
   Make sure that GitHub Codespaces has the correct port forwarding set up for external access. If necessary, expose the `8080` port in your `devcontainer.json` configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "YourApp",
     "forwardPorts": [8080]
   }
   ```

   This will ensure that GitHub Codespaces exposes the backend application correctly.

### 6. **Testing Locally:**
   To ensure the application works properly:
   - Run the application locally (without GitHub Codespaces) on `http://localhost:8080/api/data`.
   - If it works locally, the issue may be specific to Codespaces configuration or port forwarding.

### Conclusion:
- **For port configuration**: `application.properties` (for both `server.port` and `server.servlet.context-path`).
- **For CORS settings**: Keep it directly in the controller (`@CrossOrigin`).
- **For GitHub Codespaces**: Ensure that ports are correctly forwarded and check the port mappings.

Try these and let me know if it resolves your issue or if you'd like further clarification!
