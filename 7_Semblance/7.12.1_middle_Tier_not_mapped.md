Whitelabel Error Page
This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.

There was an unexpected error (type=Not Found, status=404).

why and how to fix it ?

The 404 error you're seeing typically occurs when a URL is not properly mapped to a controller in your Spring Boot application. The specific issue may arise from a few possible causes:

1. **Context Path Issue:**
   Sometimes, when deploying to GitHub Codespaces or any remote server, the application might have a context path prefix that is not included in your URL. For instance, your `/api/data` endpoint might actually be available at something like `/app/api/data`.

   **Solution**: Check if there is a base context path (e.g., `/app`) that needs to be included in the URL. You can do this by verifying your applicationâ€™s `application.properties` or `application.yml` file for any `server.servlet.context-path` setting.

2. **Missing `@RequestMapping` or Incorrect Path:**
   Ensure that your controller mapping and method mapping are correct and that the path is available. Double-check if the `@RequestMapping("/api")` and `@GetMapping("/data")` are functioning correctly.

   **Solution**: The code you posted seems fine, so ensure that the application context is correctly configured and that there are no issues with how it's running or being accessed.

3. **Spring Boot Startup Issue:**
   The application might not have started up properly, and the endpoint might not be registered in the server.

   **Solution**: Verify that the application started without any issues and that the `DataController` is registered. You can do this by checking the logs for any startup errors.

4. **Cross-Origin Issues (CORS):**
   Although you have configured `@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")`, sometimes the client and server being on different origins (e.g., GitHub Codespaces) can cause problems due to CORS misconfiguration or issues with how the frontend accesses the backend.

   **Solution**: Try checking your frontend application to make sure it's sending requests to the correct backend URL, and ensure there are no CORS-related issues blocking the request.

5. **Incorrect URL or Port Issue:**
   It seems you're accessing the endpoint via `https://supreme-system-vwrx9j7ppq2vj6-8080.app.github.dev/api/data`. Double-check the URL, ensuring the port `8080` is accessible and matches what the Spring Boot application is using. GitHub Codespaces might use a different port or protocol for the backend.

   **Solution**: Confirm that the Spring Boot app is running on port 8080 or any other port as configured in your `application.properties` file. If it's running on a different port, update the URL accordingly.

6. **GitHub Codespaces Configuration:**
   Since you mentioned using GitHub Codespaces, sometimes the environment setup might require specific configuration to allow external access to the application.

   **Solution**: Check the GitHub Codespaces documentation for any special setup instructions related to exposing Spring Boot applications via a public URL, as GitHub Codespaces may require adjustments in how the application is exposed.

If none of these fixes resolve the issue, try running the application locally or in a different environment to ensure the code is correct, and confirm if the problem lies with GitHub Codespaces or the application itself.
