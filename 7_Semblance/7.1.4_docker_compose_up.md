It looks like your `docker-compose up --build` command failed because there's no `docker-compose.yml` file in your directory. Hereâ€™s how you can fix it:

### Steps to Fix:
1. **Check if the file exists**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   ls | grep docker-compose.yml
   ```
   If the file doesnâ€™t exist, you need to create one.

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file**  
   If your project needs Docker Compose, create a new file called `docker-compose.yml` in the directory:
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     app:
       build: .
       container_name: middleware_app
       ports:
         - "8080:8080"
       volumes:
         - .:/app
       depends_on:
         - database

     database:
       image: mysql:latest
       container_name: middleware_db
       environment:
         MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
         MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
       ports:
         - "3306:3306"
   ```

3. **Ensure your `Dockerfile` is correct**  
   Check your `dockerfile` to confirm it properly builds your Java app. Rename it if necessary:
   ```bash
   mv dockerfile Dockerfile
   ```

4. **Try running again**  
   Now run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   If there are still issues, check for missing dependencies in `pom.xml`.
