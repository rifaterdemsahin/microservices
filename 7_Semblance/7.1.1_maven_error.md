The error message indicates that Maven cannot find the `pom.xml` file in the directory `/workspaces/microservices/6_Symbols/3_middleware`. Maven requires this file to build the project.

To fix this:

1. **Verify the directory**: Ensure that you are in the correct directory where the `pom.xml` file is located. You can use the `ls` command to check the contents of the directory.
   
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

2. **Navigate to the correct directory**: If the `pom.xml` file is located in a different directory, navigate to that directory using `cd` and try running the `mvn clean package` command again.

3. **Create a `pom.xml` file**: If the project does not have a `pom.xml` file, you will need to create one, or check if it's missing from version control.

Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!
