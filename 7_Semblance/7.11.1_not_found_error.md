app.js:12 
            
            
           GET https://supreme-system-vwrx9j7ppq2vj6-80.app.github.dev/api/data 404 (Not Found)



           I see the issue now! You're accessing your application through GitHub Codespaces' URL (`https://supreme-system-vwrx9j7ppq2vj6-80.app.github.dev`), which adds another layer of complexity to your setup. Let me explain the problem and provide a solution:

## The Problem

When you access your application through GitHub Codespaces, the browser is making requests to the Codespaces domain, not to `localhost`. This means:

1. Your request is going to `https://supreme-system-vwrx9j7ppq2vj6-80.app.github.dev/api/data`
2. This request is routed to your Nginx container through GitHub's proxy
3. Your Nginx configuration is set up to proxy `/api/` requests to `http://app:8080/api/`
4. However, since you're accessing via HTTPS (the GitHub domain), but your internal services use HTTP, you might have mixed content issues

## The Solution

1. First, let's ensure your Nginx configuration correctly handles the GitHub Codespaces domain:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost supreme-system-vwrx9j7ppq2vj6-80.app.github.dev;

    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://app:8080/api/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        
        # Additional headers for proxying from HTTPS to HTTP
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

2. Make sure your Spring Boot application is correctly configured with the controller:

Check that you've added the `DataController.java` file to your project and that Spring Boot is running correctly. The controller should include CORS configuration:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")  // This is important for GitHub Codespaces
public class DataController {
    // ...
}
```

3. Update your docker-compose.yml to ensure the app port is publicly accessible:

```yaml
app:
  build:
    context: ./3_middleware
    dockerfile: dockerfile
  container_name: middleware_app
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"  # Make sure this is exposed
  networks:
    - app-network
  depends_on:
    - database
```

4. Since GitHub Codespaces proxies your application, update your app.js to use a relative URL that works regardless of the domain:

```javascript
const response = await fetch("/api/data");
```

## Steps to Apply Changes

1. Update your Nginx configuration file with the changes above
2. Verify your Spring Boot controller is in place with CORS enabled
3. Make sure ports are correctly exposed in docker-compose.yml
4. Rebuild and restart your containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

After these changes, your application should work correctly when accessed through the GitHub Codespaces URL. The key is ensuring that Nginx correctly proxies the API requests from the GitHub domain to your Spring Boot container.
