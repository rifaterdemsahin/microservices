It looks like you're encountering an issue where the `middleware_app` container is unable to access the `app.jar` file. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Verify the JAR file's existence:**
   Make sure that the `ntier-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file is indeed in the `target` directory. If it's missing, you may need to build the project first to generate the JAR file:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```
   This should generate the JAR file in the `target` directory.

2. **Ensure the correct volume mapping:**
   Your `docker-compose.yml` defines the following volume mapping for the `app` service:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - .:/app
   ```
   This maps the current directory (`.`) to the `/app` directory in the container. Make sure that the `ntier-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file exists in the current directory on your host machine. If it's not in the root directory of your project, Docker will not be able to copy it into the container.

3. **Check Dockerfile path:**
   Your `Dockerfile` copies the JAR file with:
   ```dockerfile
   COPY target/ntier-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar
   ```
   This assumes that the JAR file is inside the `target` folder. Verify that the path is correct. If the JAR file is elsewhere, update the `COPY` instruction with the correct path.

4. **Rebuild the Docker images:**
   After verifying the above steps, rebuild the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. **Check the logs:**
   If the issue persists, check the logs of the `middleware_app` container for more details:
   ```bash
   docker logs middleware_app
   ```

If these steps don't resolve the issue, let me know, and we can investigate further.

The error message `Unable to access jarfile app.jar` indicates that the application is not able to find the `app.jar` file at runtime. Here's a checklist of things to review and try:

### 1. **Confirm JAR File in Target Folder**
   Ensure that the `ntier-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file is present in the `target/` folder. If the file doesn't exist, you need to build the project using Maven (or Gradle, depending on your setup):
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

### 2. **Correct COPY Path in Dockerfile**
   In your `Dockerfile`, the command to copy the JAR file is:
   ```dockerfile
   COPY target/ntier-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar
   ```
   This assumes the `target` folder is in the same directory as your `Dockerfile`. If the JAR file is located elsewhere, adjust the `COPY` command accordingly.

### 3. **Check Volume Mounting**
   Your `docker-compose.yml` has the following volume mapping for the app:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - .:/app
   ```
   This means the current directory (where `docker-compose.yml` is located) is mounted as `/app` inside the container. Make sure that the `target/ntier-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file is available in the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` is located.

### 4. **Rebuild the Docker Images**
   After verifying the steps above, rebuild your Docker containers to ensure everything is up to date:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### 5. **Verify File Existence in the Container**
   Once the container is up and running, you can check if the `app.jar` file is available inside the container:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it middleware_app ls /app
   ```
   This will show the contents of the `/app` directory inside the container, and you can verify if `app.jar` is present.

Let me know if these steps help or if you encounter any further issues!
