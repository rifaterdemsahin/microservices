UI

// app.js, which fetches data from your Spring Boot backend when the button is clicked. Let me know if you need any changes or enhancements! ðŸš€
//  Change how the frontend accesses the API. When running in Docker, your frontend should use the service name instead of localhost:

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    const button = document.getElementById("fetchData");
    const dataParagraph = document.getElementById("data");

    button.addEventListener("click", async () => {
        try {
            // When running in Docker, use the service name as the hostname
            // For local development, you might need to switch this back to localhost
            const response = await fetch("/api/data");
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
            }
            const data = await response.json();
            dataParagraph.textContent = JSON.stringify(data, null, 2);
        } catch (error) {
            dataParagraph.textContent = "Error fetching data: " + error.message;
        }
    });
});

why does not middleware respond or ui cant call it 

Based on your configuration, I see a few potential issues that could be preventing your UI from successfully connecting to your middleware. Let's address them systematically:

## Issue #1: Incorrect Nginx Configuration File Path

In your docker-compose.yml, you're trying to mount an nginx configuration from:
```yaml
- ./2_frontend/nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro
```

But based on your earlier messages, you created the nginx config at:
```bash
mkdir -p nginx
touch nginx/default.conf
```

So there's a mismatch in paths. The config should be at the project root's `nginx/default.conf` not inside the `2_frontend` directory.

## Issue #2: Missing Port Expose in Middleware Service

Your middleware service definition doesn't expose port 8080:

```yaml
app:
  build:
    context: ./3_middleware
    dockerfile: dockerfile
  container_name: middleware_app
  networks:
    - app-network
  depends_on:
    - database
```

While the Dockerfile exposes port 8080, you should also expose it in your docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
app:
  build:
    context: ./3_middleware
    dockerfile: dockerfile
  container_name: middleware_app
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"  # Add this line
  networks:
    - app-network
  depends_on:
    - database
```

## Issue #3: Potential Missing Controller Configuration

From your messages, it's not clear if you've actually added the REST controller to your Spring Boot application. Make sure you've added the `DataController.java` file I provided in your middleware project at:
```
3_middleware/src/main/java/com/example/controller/DataController.java
```

## Steps to Fix

1. Correct your docker-compose.yml to mount the nginx config from the right location:
```yaml
web:
  image: nginx:latest
  container_name: web_server
  volumes:
    - ./2_frontend:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
    - ./nginx/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:ro  # Fix this path
  ports:
    - "80:80"
  depends_on:
    - app
  networks:
    - app-network
```

2. Add port exposure to your middleware service:
```yaml
app:
  build:
    context: ./3_middleware
    dockerfile: dockerfile
  container_name: middleware_app
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"  # Add this line
  networks:
    - app-network
  depends_on:
    - database
```

3. Verify that you've added the REST controller to your Spring Boot application.

4. Rebuild and restart your containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

5. Check logs to see if there are any errors:
```bash
docker-compose logs app
docker-compose logs web
```

## Additional Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues after making these changes, try:

1. Testing your API directly from the host:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/data
```

2. Check if your Spring Boot application is actually running:
```bash
docker-compose exec app ps aux | grep java
```

3. Check if nginx is correctly proxying requests:
```bash
docker-compose exec web cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

4. Look at browser console errors for any CORS issues.

Implementing these fixes should resolve the communication issues between your UI and middleware.
