It looks like the build is failing because the JAR file can't be found at the specified location. This is a common issue when the path in the Dockerfile doesn't match the actual structure. Let me help you fix this:

## Issue Analysis

The error message indicates that Docker can't find the JAR file at `./target/ntier-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` relative to your build context. This is because your JAR is actually in the `3_middleware/target/` directory based on your tree structure.

## Solution

Let's modify your approach to correctly reference the JAR file:

1. First, update your Dockerfile in `3_middleware/dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
WORKDIR /app

# Use the correct path relative to the build context
COPY target/ntier-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

2. Then modify your docker-compose.yml to set the proper build context:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./3_middleware
      dockerfile: dockerfile
    container_name: middleware_app
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./3_middleware:/app
    depends_on:
      - database
```

The key change here is setting the `context: ./3_middleware` which makes Docker use that directory as the base for finding files referenced in the Dockerfile.

## Commands to Rebuild

Now, run these commands to rebuild:

```bash
# Stop any running containers
docker-compose down

# Rebuild with the updated configuration
docker-compose build app

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d
```

If you still encounter issues, you can verify the JAR's existence with:

```bash
ls -la 3_middleware/target/ntier-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

If the JAR isn't there, you might need to rebuild your Maven project before attempting the Docker build:

```bash
cd 3_middleware
mvn clean package
cd ..
docker-compose build app
docker-compose up -d
```

This approach ensures Docker can find the JAR file by setting the correct build context and maintaining the file paths relative to that context.

Good news - your JAR file exists and has the correct path. Now I can see why Docker is having trouble finding it. Let's make a few specific changes to fix this issue:

## Updated Dockerfile

Create a new version of your Dockerfile at `3_middleware/dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR file with absolute path
COPY target/ntier-application-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /app/app.jar

# Verify the JAR exists (useful for debugging)
RUN ls -la /app

# Expose port and run application with absolute path
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
```

## Updated docker-compose.yml

Modify your docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./3_middleware
      dockerfile: dockerfile
    container_name: middleware_app
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - database

  database:
    image: mysql:latest
    container_name: backend_db
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"

  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: web_server
    volumes:
      - ./2_frontend:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - app
```

## Rebuild Commands

Now let's rebuild with specific commands:

```bash
# First remove any existing containers
docker-compose down

# Remove any old image to start fresh
docker rmi $(docker images -q middleware_app) || true

# Build with verbose output and no cache
docker-compose build --no-cache app

# Start the service
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs to see what's happening
docker-compose logs app
```

The key changes I've made:

1. Using absolute paths in the Dockerfile to ensure Java knows exactly where the JAR is
2. Adding the RUN command to verify the JAR exists in the container during build
3. Simplifying the docker-compose.yml to focus on the build context
4. Removing any cached images before rebuilding

This should resolve the "Unable to access jarfile" error as long as the JAR is being properly copied during the build process.
